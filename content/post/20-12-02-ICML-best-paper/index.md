### About the Work

The rapid growth of **photovoltaic (PV) systems** has transformed distribution networks, but high penetration levels introduce challenges such as overvoltage, reverse power flow, and increased losses. To address these, our paper proposes a **stochastic approach based on Monte Carlo simulation** to estimate the **Hosting Capacity (HC)** of real Brazilian distribution systems.

Key aspects include:

- Use of **historical irradiance and temperature data** to create realistic PV generation profiles.  
- **Probabilistic allocation** of PV units across medium-voltage busbars, reflecting real-world installation trends.  
- Evaluation of **voltage stability, losses, and reverse power flow** under various PV penetration rates.  
- Insights into the trade-off: low penetration mitigates undervoltage, while high penetration (>80–120%) introduces significant overvoltage risks.  

### Results

- Moderate PV penetration improves **voltage profiles** and **reduces active power losses**.  
- High penetration rates cause **critical overvoltage** and **loss variability**.  
- The methodology highlights the importance of **strategic PV placement** and **penetration control** to maximize HC.
