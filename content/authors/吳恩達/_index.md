**Gustavo Lino Morales Espinoza** is a PhD researcher at the **University of São Paulo (USP)**, member of the **RCGI / InnovaPower** group. His research focuses on **distribution expansion planning**, **stochastic DER allocation (PV/BESS)**, **hosting capacity**, and **power quality analysis** (SAIDI/SAIFI, VTCD) using **OpenDSS and Python-based frameworks**.

He develops methodologies based on **Monte Carlo simulations** and **evolutionary algorithms** (GA, NSGA-II, PSO, WOA) to address problems such as energy losses, reverse power flow, and voltage violations in Brazilian distribution networks.

In addition to his doctoral research, he collaborates in the development of a collaborative **Hosting Capacity web platform** and teaches **Python and Smart Grids** topics for undergraduate and graduate students.
